		<h1> 5 Resume Writing Tips from - </h1>
		<h1><a href="http://www.dailywritingtips.com/resume-writing-tips">Daily Writing Tips</a></h1>
		<br>
		<h1>Know the purpose of your resume</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Some people write a resume as if the purpose of the
		document was to land a job. As a result they end up with a really long
		and boring piece that makes them look like desperate job hunters.
		The objective of your resume is to land an interview, and the
		interview will land you the job.</p>
		<h1>Back up your qualities and strengths</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Instead of creating a long (and boring)
		list with all your qualities (e.g., disciplined,
		creative, problem solver) try to connect them with
		real life and work experiences. In other words, you
		need to back these qualities and strengths up, else
		it will appear that you are just trying to inflate things.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Make sure to use the right keywords</h1>
		<p>Most companies are already using digital databases
		to search for candidates. This means that the HR department
		will run search queries based on specific keywords. Guess what,
		if your resume doesn't have the keywords related to the job you are
		applying for, you will be out even before the game starts.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Use effective titles</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Like it or not, employers will usually make
		a judgment about your resume in 5 seconds. Under
		this time frame the most important aspect will be
		the titles that you listed on the resume, so make
		sure they grab the attention. Try to be as descriptive
		as possible, giving the employer a good idea about the
		nature of your past work experiences.</p>
		<p>Bad title: Accounting</p>
		<p>Good title: Management of A/R and A/P and Recordkeeping</p>
		<h1>Proofread it twice</h1>
		<br>
		<p>It would be difficult to emphasize the importance of
		proofreading your resume. One small typo and your chances
		of getting hired could slip. Proofreading it once is not enough,
		so do it twice, three times or as many as necessary.</p>
