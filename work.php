          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>One of the first projects in introduction to programming that gave me a chance to shine as a programmer.
          Before that I felt like I had to stay within the confines of predetermined logic to make my programs run.</p>
          <p>But during this project, I decided to break the mold and try something different then I was used to.
          I decided to try using a built-in function to eliminate any non alphabetical characters.</p>
          <p>The function that I decided to use was the replace function that I was used in previous assignments and
          knew it was the best choice to make the program less likely to misbehave when the user gives it non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
          <p>In closing statement, the most important thing that I can say about this project and why it is in my portfolio;
          Is that it helped to boost my self-confidence and reassured me that I was taking the right coursework.</p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>One of the first classes I had during my first year was introduction to
          database which was taught using Access. I had little experience using
          access/databases beforehand so it was actually hard for me to move around
          the user interface and understand the key database concepts</p>
          <p>But through working with my fellow students and faculty, I was able to grasp
          the key concepts and actually become better in working in the environment.
          This helped me later on when I began learning more complex database concepts
          in the following semester and beyond.</p>
          <p>The ultimate reason for why I chose this for my portfolio is that it i
          s a memorable piece of my studies and reminds me of how much I have grown since
          the beginning of my studies at NSCC.</p>

          <p>This assignment was one of the first to take me out of my comfort zone.
          This was due to the scale of the assignment and how documented the assignment was supposed to be.</p>
          <p>After taking the time go through the assignment and documenting each portion ,
          I found that my assumption about the assignment was wrong and wasn't really that
          far out of my own abilities.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the purpose of this entry. It taught me to
          not judge an assignment by its description.</p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>This was one of the very first assignments in the
          beginning of the intro to java course during my first year.
          It was mainly based on following along with the teacher and
          she provided one java file for the console implementation.</p>
          
          <p>I found this assignment was interesting and engaging as
          I had never experienced working with java nor worked along a
          teacher on an assignment. before. Because of this, I wanted to
          put this entry into my portfolio as it marks a new experience for
          me during my studies and ultimately led to my success in my studies
          related to java/programming</p>

          <p>This was one of the first assignments where I
          felt I had an advantage going in. This is because
          I had prior experience using command line networking
          tools in high school and experimenting in my free time.</p>
          
          <p>After reviewing the concepts we learned that day

          <p>During my high school years, I didn't have much luck with
          writing reports as I found they were tedious and not on
          subjects that I enjoy.</p>
          
          <p>But during this report assignment on comparing emulation and simulation,
          I became highly interested in the report topic. Due to my interest, I took it
          upon myself to improve my report writing skills as I wanted to display the topic
          the best way that I can.</p>
          <p>This resulted in the report that I passed in for the assignment.
          Due to having taken an interest, I found that it was easier to write
          the report and because of that I was happy with the overall result.</p>

          <p>Of any of the documents which I have chosen for my portfolio,
          the stress plan is one of the most important pieces that I can
          put in.</p>
          
          <p>This is because, I have always had a problem during with my
          own personal stresses and never really knew of ways to deal with them.
          After being tasked with creating my stress plan, I made sure to take to
          heart the suggestions that I wrote within my plan and try to stick to
          them as much as possible.</p>
          <p>It was not until my father passed away last year that I felt I needed
          to revisit my stress plan to get myself back on track. This was because I
          had always relied on my father as my anchor to help me in times when I was
          stressed out. And when he was suddenly taken from me, I needed the advice
          from this document more than ever.</p>
          
          <p>If it wasn't for this stress plan, I wouldn't be as solid a person
          that I am today, sitting here and writing this reflection. I want to personally
          thank Sharla Rolfe-Hunter for creating this assignment and hope she gets a chance
          to see this on consolidation day.</p>

          <p>One of the things that I am most proud of in my first year
          of studies was the NFC Report that I did for two classes,
          Technical Communications and Technical Foundations. I am proud of
          this document because it is one of the best examples of my growth
          in writing technical documents.</p>
          
          <p>The reason that this is the best example is because I had never written
          a document at such a length before in my pre-college studies. Before college,
          I always had trouble writing lengthy documents as I was not subjected to writing anything
          longer than a few pages. But due to my interest in the topic that was chosen for the paper,
          I made sure that I did my research thoroughly and displayed that in my document.</p>
          
          <p>Lastly, I want to say that I hope my research paper will be of interest to anyone
          who visits my portfolio website as I will proudly talk about it.</p>

          <p>One of the things that I noticed after going back through this
          portfolio entry was the difference in my programming style from then
          until now. Back then, I seemed to favour a longer style of doing things
          (example, not using for loops when appropriate and essentially hard-coding items). </p>
          <p>But after the experience I gained in the courses thereafter, I noticed how much
          I have improved in that respect due to continuous practice and utilizing different syntaxes.
          I believe that I have become a much more component programmer and this final portion is a reminder
          of days where I was just beginning.</p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>During the second semester of my first year at NSCC, one of the assignments
          that was to be done was a web application of my choosing with the topic of course
          selection at NSCC.</p>
          <p>I decided to make a small periodic table of courses to show the
          different course paths in information technology that are available at NSCC.</p>
          <p>Because of the coursework prior to this assignment prepared me well.
          I decided to go outside the normal and found a website template to use for
          this project. As well I wanted to add something different to this small site
          so I did some research and found a interesting navigation menu that resembles
          the windows file structure.</p>
          <p>One of highlights of working on this assignment was trying to figure out how
          to correctly manipulate the code that was provided so that the navigation would
          end up as I wanted.</p>
          <p>I spent a lot of my time, fixing mistakes and became very frustrated at the fact that
          it wasn't working as I had hoped. But then I decided to take a break from the project
          so that I could look at it at a different angle after working a separate assignment.</p>
          <p>After going back and finishing the project, I was amazed at how well the website
          looked and felt when I was browsing it. As well, I had gotten some great feedback from
          one of my teachers that the website was a great example of how a course-selection website
          should look like. This boosted my confidence in my own abilities and that is why I feel it
          is an important item in my portfolio.</p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>During my first year, I was not able to find a work placement
          outside of the school for my first work-term. So I was placed on an
          in-house project of my choosing which resulted in my choosing to learn
          some android development. Because of my keen interest in the subjrect,
          I was more than happier to dive right into develop and had a idea of where
          I wanted to go with it.</p>
          <p>Sadly, during the development of my application called NFCTag, it was
          cut short due to the sudden passing of my father and I had to take time off to recover.
          But I was able to return to my project the week after because I wanted to keep going as
          that was what my father would have wanted.</p>
          <p>As much as I am not satisfied with the amount of the project that got done,
          the main idea that I got from the experience is to never give up even when life
          throws you curve balls.</p>
          <p>Because of that, that's why I feel this entry is an important part of my
          development as a person and believe that this moved me to the person that I am today.</p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>During the first part of my second year of studies,
          I was tasked with being the chair of a meeting that would
          occur the following week.</p>
          <p>Due to previous experience in meetings that I had
          when I was a part of the health and safety committee at Tim hortons years before.
          I felt confident that I would be able to fulfill my duties as chair.</p>
          <p>One of the things that I pride myself on is being informed as much as possible before
          making decisions that will affect myself and others.
          So when I was tasked with creating the agenda for the next meeting,</p>
          <p> I made sure to contact our teacher for any details that I needed in order
          to correctly write up the document, as well know exactly who would be presenting
          information at the next meeting. I feel this is a great example of my leadership
          and organization skills as I wanted to make sure the next meeting occurred as I had
          written in the document and took due diligence to make sure everyone was on track for
          that meeting.</p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3>
          
          <p>During the last semester before the work term, We had a
          course on special topics where the faculty would choose
          a topic outside of the regular curriculum. During the first part of
          this course, J2EE was chosen as a topic.</p>
          
          <p>Because of my previous knowledge in java, I felt that I would not
          have any issue with learning the topic. Because of my arrogance, I was not prepared
          for what the courses objectives would be and felt lost as I was trying to complete
          the first assignment.</p>
          
          <p>With much aid and looking through examples that were given to me by my faculty,
          I was finally able to understand how to work with the J2EE environment.</p>
          
          <p>As each of the assignments built upon each other, I found that my difficulty
          was only a hindrance in the beginning and with the excellent help I was receiving.
          I found that I was able to complete the project sections on time and correctly.</p>
          <p>As I went through documenting each of the project steps, I began to realize that
          this document would be an excellent example to put in my portfolio as it showcases
          my ability to work with web-based java and my ability to create technical documents
          to the best of my ability.</p>
          <p>In ending, I became very proud that I was able to accomplish my goals
          in this project and have an excellent piece to show to potential employers.</p>

          <p>One of the more recent of my portfolio entries and
          one of the best examples of my development from my first year
          of programming til now.</p>
          <p>During the final, I was having trouble deciding upon how
          I was going to implement the program that was set out for us on
          the final exam. As I had never done a graphics based program in C#
          before. I felt nervous that I would not be able to finish that portion
          of the exam on time.</p>
          <p>But suddenly after thinking about the task at hand, I was reminded
          of a previous assignment that I had done before this course. After rummaging
          through my old coursework, I found the java turtles assignment where I had coded
          the way that the turtles interact with the boundaries of the drawing area. Since
          C# and are similar in their syntax, I decided to plug in the calculations to see
          if they would work with the bouncing ball algorithm.</p>
          <p>After successfully integrating the collision code into my program,
          I became overjoyed with the fact that I was able to pull from prior
          coursework effectively and quickly. </p>
          <p>I believe that this is an excellent example of how resourceful I can be
          when under pressure by a time limit and feel that because of that experience
          during the final, that I feel more confident in taking risks in future endeavours</p>

          <p>Of everything in my portfolio, I feel that this is one of the most important
          pieces that I can showcase. Ever since I enrolled in NSCC, I wanted to learn more
          than just normal programming concepts.</p>
          <p> I wanted to learn about gaming development. Sadly as the program does
          not contain any coursework related to game development, I had to look elsewhere.
          However during the last part of this second year. I was given the chance to learn
          something different from the regular coursework. Because of my interest in gaming,
          I decided to look for online courses that would teach me how to work in a game design
          environment. Thankfully due to a fellow classmate's interest in gaming as well,
          I was directed to learning about unity. After taking the online course on game development
          in unity, I aspired to create my own game prototype for my capstone project.</p>
          <p> I wanted to do this because I thought it would be a good idea to have an item
          in my portfolio to show that I possess the knowledge, skills and will power to create
          a game to show to potentail employers in the gaming industry.</p>
          <p>After six long weeks of hard work, I was able to create a small prototype
          game which I named Z-find and was able to showcase my game at the Technology
          Showcase that happened last april. It was one of the most important moments
          in my life as I was actually able to show my passion for gaming in regards to my Career.
          I personally want to thank the staff at NSCC for allowing me to have one small
          piece of my dream realized, Thank you.</p>
